# Vicsek-model
Code for Vicsek's model which gives the same results as presented in the original paper: https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.75.1226
The Animation.ipynb code includes a modified version of the Vicsek's model with volume exclusions taken into account. 
As it turns out Vicsek's model with or without volume interactions show the same qualitative behaviour.
